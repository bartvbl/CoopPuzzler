CoopPuzzler
===========

CoopPuzzler is a tool to do crosswords on the computer. It's named after its most important feature: it allows for puzzles to be solved with others over the internet.

The idea is that you start with a crossword puzzle, perhaps the one you find in your local newspaper. You then "copy" it into the tool, which you can then use to solve it.

This might seem a waste of time; you have it on a piece of paper in front of you, so why bother? From my personal extensive testing it is surprisingly comfortable. Being able to zoom in on any part of the puzzle and not having to mess with writing on a newspaper resting on your leg surprisingly does make a big difference.

To try it, find the latest release in the /CoopPuzzler/builds folder. The zip contains a .jar file that you can run by double-clicking. It should work on every operating system, though it has only been tested on windows and OSX.

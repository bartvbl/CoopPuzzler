CoopPuzzler
===========

CoopPuzzler is a tool to do crosswords on the computer. It's named after its most important feature: it allows for puzzles to be solved with others over the internet.

To try it, find the latest release in the builds folder. The zip contains a .jar file that you can run by double-clicking. It should work on every operating system, though it has only been tested on windows and OSX.

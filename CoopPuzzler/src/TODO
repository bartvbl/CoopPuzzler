Todo list:
- write a UI acting as a main menu. It should contain an option for online or offline play, and writing the server accordingly.
- fixing all the server exceptions when a client disconnects. I think we'll also need some graceful disconnect handlers when the app wants to shut down.

- celebrate after the exams that it turned out so well :D
